Stage 1: pull the currency-neutral growth breakdown out of the two source
PDFs.

adidas doesn't disclose a price/volume bridge (see data/raw/README.md for
how that was checked before this design was picked). What it discloses,
consistently, is:

- Financial Highlights: net sales, gross profit, EBITDA, operating profit,
  net income, and the margin/working-capital/capex ratios behind them
- Net sales by product division: Footwear / Apparel / Accessories
- Net sales by channel: Wholesale / Direct-to-Consumer (only in the 2025
  report as an explicit euro table — the 2024 report only gives the DTC
  share of sales as a narrative percentage, so 2023/2024 channel euros are
  derived from that share, not directly disclosed)
- Targets – Results – Outlook: adidas's own stated guidance for the
  following fiscal year, which becomes this project's planning-assumption
  input for the backtest

A real restatement wrinkle showed up while extracting this: the FY2025
report's FY2024 comparatives don't match the FY2024 report's own FY2024
figures. Product division is the sharpest example — Accessories 2024 goes
from € 1,499m (as originally reported) to € 1,779m (as restated, footnoted
"reclassification within the product divisions") — an ~19% gap. This
module keeps both versions rather than picking one, tagged by which report
they came from; which one becomes "the" 2024 baseline for the model is a
decision made explicitly in src/model.py, not silently defaulted here.

The Targets–Results–Outlook table's cells wrap across PDF text lines in a
way that makes column-position parsing unreliable (a wrapped two-line
target description produces the same whitespace signature as an actual
column boundary). Rather than force a generic parser onto genuinely
ambiguous text, the guidance figures are extracted by searching for the
exact phrases confirmed present in the source text — verified against both
PDFs before being hardcoded as search targets. If adidas changes this
wording in a future report, the search fails loudly (raises) instead of
silently extracting the wrong number.
